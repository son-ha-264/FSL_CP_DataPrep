# FSL_CP_DataPrep
Preparing data for few-shot learning with Cell Painting Assay

## NOTE
The image processing part (script 9 in particular), is severely outdated and we don't have plan to upadate it in the near future. If you want to use this code for Cell Painting image processing, please send me an email to the address below and we can discuss how to adapt the codes for your need.  

## How to use
Order for running scripts: From 1 to 12 (11 can be skipped since we no longer use jsonl files)


## Extra folders needed
/csv folder with 'chemical_annotations.csv', 'processed_data_concat.csv'

/sql folder with 'chembl_31_sqlite/chembl_31.db', or any version of ChEMBL

Blank /jsonl, /temp and /output folder. The /jsonl and /output folder contain the final data 

Also refer to the screenshot attached for the layout of the folder
